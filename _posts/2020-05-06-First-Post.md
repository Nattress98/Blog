title: First Post! Game Development Blog
---

Hi, so I'm going to be writing here as a way to help keep me motivated on my projects. I'm going to start with a bit of an about me.

I'm a 21 year old junior Unity developer, working at a bespoke software development company, where I develop primarily VR/AR applications intended for business use. I'm also heading into my final year at Northumbria University Newcastle. All going well, I will graduate with a BSc in Computer Science with a focus on Game Development in June 2021. I am very interested in Virtual Reality development and expect that it will only continue to grow over the coming years.
